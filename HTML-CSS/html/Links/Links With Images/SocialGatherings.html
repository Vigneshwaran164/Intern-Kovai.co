                A great benefit of social gatherings is meeting new people. Whether it’s a formal or casual gathering, you’re likely to meet some interesting and unique people outside of your circle. 
                These connections you form can become great friendships, business networks, and more! If you’re a little shyer, there’s also the benefit of spending time with the people you’re familiar with and love to see! At social gatherings, people are usually much more relaxed as well, so spending quality time with these friends and peers can be tons of fun!
